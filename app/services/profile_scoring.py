    Service for scoring GitHub profiles and generating recommendations using AI.
    
    This service analyzes a user's GitHub profile and repositories to:
    1. Score their profile for specific job roles (frontend, backend, etc.)
    2. Generate personalized recommendations to improve their profile
    
    It uses OpenAI's API to perform the analysis, sending repository data
    and receiving structured feedback that can help users improve their
    GitHub presence for job applications.

    - Fetching repository data from GitHub
    - Preparing that data for AI analysis
    - Processing AI responses into structured feedback
    - Error handling and fallbacks when AI analysis fails
